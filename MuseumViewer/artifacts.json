    "description" : "During the long, peaceful reign of Amenhotep III, Egypt reached a pinnacle of wealth and splendor. This magnificent portrait captures the ruler's exotic features to perfection. He has large, almond-shaped eyes, elegant arched eyebrows, and a full mouth. His face is youthful and without blemish. The bone structure is lost in the fleshy fullness of the face. The contrast between polished and roughened surfaces is a hallmark of hard stone images of Amenhotep III. The flesh areas were smoothed to a glistening sheen, while the eyeballs and the crown were left rougher. The roughening of the crown also had a practical purpose, for the upper portion was originally painted blue and the browband was painted yellow. The paint would have adhered better to the unpolished surface.",

    "description" : "Over the years, archaeologists have uncovered many different kinds of clay figurines—dogū—dating to Japan’s prehistoric Jōmon period (14,000–300 bce)­. The most diverse forms have been excavated in northeastern Japan, where this figurine of a female was discovered. Some are seated, others standing, some have heart-shaped heads, others round and wearing headpieces, some have little or no surface decoration, and others, like this example, known as a shakōki or “goggle-eyed” type, have distinctive large eyes and are adorned with color and complex carved decorations. No one knows for sure how these figurines were used, but there are several theories. The prevailing theory holds that they served as talismans related to health and childbirth, and that after they were used they were purposefully broken and disposed of, which may account for the fact that dogū are found with missing limbs or other seemingly purposeful breaks.",
